# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** to understand the relationship between various lifestyle factors and sleep quality. Using simple linear regression, we aim to predict the quality of sleep based on multiple input features such as sleep duration, physical activity level, stress level, age, and heart rate.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is titled **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**. It contains information about individuals' sleep patterns, lifestyle choices, and health metrics. The key columns in the dataset include:

- **Person ID**: Unique identifier for each participant.
- **Gender**: Gender of the participant.
- **Age**: Age of the participant.
- **Occupation**: Job title of the participant.
- **Sleep Duration**: Average hours of sleep per night.
- **Quality of Sleep**: Self-reported quality of sleep on a scale (1-10).
- **Physical Activity Level**: Average daily physical activity measured in minutes.
- **Stress Level**: Self-reported stress level on a scale (1-10).
- **BMI Category**: Body Mass Index category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
- **Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure reading (systolic/diastolic).
- **Heart Rate**: Average heart rate in beats per minute.
- **Daily Steps**: Average number of steps taken daily.
- **Sleep Disorder**: Any diagnosed sleep disorders.
